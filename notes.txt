Basic webpack / babel setup:

Transpile es6 to es2015:
./node_modules/.bin/babel index.js -o ./bundle.js --presets=es2015

-> this creates ./bundle.js

If es2015 added in .babelrc:
./node_modules/.bin/babel index.js -o ./bundle.js

After adding 

"build": "./node_modules/.bin/babel ./index.js -o ./bundle.js"

to "scripts" in package.json, the build can be run with 

yarn build

To build webpack in bundle.js:
node_modules/.bin/webpack ./index.js -o ./bundle.js

After adding path etc to webpack.config.js we can just run
node_modules/.bin/webpack

To automate, we can make a webpack.config.js, see comments there

Now we can change the build in package.json to webpack, as webpack is now used to build and it already calls babel in it's config:
"build": "./node_modules/.bin/babel ./index.js -o ./bundle.js"
-> 
"build": "./node_modules/.bin/webpack"

After adding webpack-dev-server, we can change 
"start": "node ./index.js", -> this doesn't exist anymore as we moved it to "src", as we specify in webpack.config.js
to 
"start": "./node_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server"

For bundling binary / static files, refer tocomments in webpack config

React:

functional components vs class components:
functional comp are
- shorter
- easy to test (are normal functions)
- no state or lifecycle hooks

props:
- component parameters
- never modify! (inside component)
- any time of data (numbers, array, objects, functions...)
- in class components accessed with this.props
- in functional components passes as arguments

propTypes:
- prevent bugs in props
- logs errors to 
- comes in package 'prop-types'


dotenv:
yarn add dotenv --dev
.env file should not be comitted and holds local variables
